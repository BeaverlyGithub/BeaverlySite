    <h1>Refund Policy (Beaverly®)</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 30, 2026</p>
  </header>

  <section class="section">
    <p>This Refund Policy (“Policy”) applies to all paid subscriptions to Chilla™ and other 
        paid services offered by Beaverly Innovative Systems Ltd. (“Beaverly,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) 
        through the Beaverly website and applications (collectively, the “Services”). 
        This Policy is a part of our Terms of Service (available at beaverlyai.com/terms) and should be read in conjunction with it.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>1. General Policy Statement</h2>
    <p>By subscribing to a paid plan for Chilla™ or any paid Services, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All subscription fees are charged in advance for the billing period selected (monthly or yearly).</li>
      <li>Fees are non-refundable except as permitted under this Policy or as required by applicable law.</li>
      <li>Beaverly provides technology infrastructure to automate your instructions and 
        does not guarantee profits, results, or financial performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>2. Non-Refundable Circumstances</h2>
    <p>You are not eligible for a refund in the following cases:</p>

    <h3>a. Change of Mind or Dissatisfaction With Outcomes</h3>
    <p>You may not request a refund because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You did not earn profits or returns.</li>
      <li>You did not use the Services as you expected.</li>
      <li>You no longer wish to use the Services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Market outcomes, trading losses, or strategy performance do not constitute grounds for a refund.</p>

    <h3>b. Partial Usage</h3>
    <p>If you have accessed or used any part of the paid Services during the paid period, no refund will be issued for that period.</p>

    <h3>c. After Billing Period Begins</h3>
    <p>If the billing period corresponding to your subscription has already commenced (e.g., after payment capture), that payment is final.</p>

    <h3>d. Violations</h3>
    <p>If your account is suspended or terminated due to violation of our Terms of Service or misuse, no refund will be provided.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. Refund Exceptions (Limited & Specific)</h2>
    <p>We may consider refunds only under the following technical circumstances:</p>

    <h3>a. Billing Errors</h3>
    <p>If an incorrect charge occurs due to a genuine billing error (e.g., duplicate charge, wrong amount), 
        you may request a refund within 30 days of the charge.</p>

    <h3>b. Unauthorized Charges</h3>
    <p>If your account was charged without your authorization, you may request a refund, 
        but you must notify us promptly and provide evidence of unauthorized use.</p>

    <h3>c. Service Non-Delivery</h3>
    <p>If the Services were not delivered due to a verified technical system failure for a sustained period 
        (e.g., the entire paid month), and we cannot restore service within a reasonable timeframe, we may issue a pro-rated refund at our discretion.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Such exceptions are rare and evaluated case-by-case. Refunds under these scenarios are processed at our sole discretion.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>To request a refund under the limited eligibility above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email support at: <strong>support@beaverlyai.com</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Provide your:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full name and email address associated with your account</li>
      <li>Transaction date and amount</li>
      <li>Reason for the refund request</li>
      <li>Any supporting documentation (billing statements, screenshots)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Allow up to 10 business days for review.</p>
    <p>Refunds, if approved, will be processed via the original payment method within 5–15 business days, depending on your payment provider.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. Cancellation & Future Billing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may cancel your subscription at any time via your dashboard.</li>
      <li>Cancellation stops future billing but does not trigger a refund for the current billing period.</li>
      <li>Your paid access remains active until the end of the period you already paid for.</li>
      <li>Downgrades take effect on the next billing cycle.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>6. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
    <p>Filing a chargeback with your bank without first contacting support may result in account suspension or termination.</p>
    <p>If a refund is legitimately owed under this Policy, we will process it via the original payment method — not via chargeback.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>7. Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>This Policy does not limit any statutory rights provided under the applicable laws of your jurisdiction. 
        If local consumer law requires a refund under certain circumstances, those statutory rights will apply where enforceable.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email or in-app notifications. 
        Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
