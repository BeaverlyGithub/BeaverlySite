<h1>Risk Disclosure</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 28, 2025</p>

<h2>Platform Classification</h2>

<p>
<strong>Beaverly® is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform providing user-configured automation and workflow tools that operate exclusively on third-party platforms under user authorization.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Beaverly Innovative Systems Ltd. is an AI financial technology platform and does not operate as a licensed financial advisor, broker-dealer, or banking institution. We do not offer personalized investment advice, solicit securities, or guarantee any financial outcomes. All trading activities are executed at the sole discretion of the user via third-party platforms. Use of our automation tools, including Chilla™, involves inherent market risk, including but not limited to the loss of invested capital. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Beaverly® does not hold, manage, or custody user funds at any time. Information provided is for general educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation. Users are solely responsible for their financial decisions and are advised to consult licensed professionals where necessary. Beaverly Innovative Systems Ltd disclaims all liability for losses or damages arising from trading activity, third-party platform failures, latency, data inaccuracies, or service interruptions. Use of this service constitutes your acceptance of our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and confirms that you are over 18 and understand the financial risks involved.
</p>

<h2>1. General Risk Warning</h2>

<p>
Participation in financial markets involves substantial risk and may not be suitable for all individuals.
Losses may exceed expectations, and in some cases may occur rapidly.
You should carefully consider your financial situation, risk tolerance, and objectives before using any
automation tools.
</p>

<p>
Beaverly® does not assess the suitability of the Services for your circumstances.
You remain solely responsible for determining whether the Services align with your needs.
</p>

<h2>2. No Investment Advice or Recommendations</h2>

<p>
Beaverly Innovative Systems Ltd. does not provide investment advice, market advice, portfolio management,
or recommendations of any kind.
</p>

<p>
Any behaviours, templates, logic, or automation configurations available on the platform are provided
for general automation purposes only and do not constitute advice, signals, or recommendations regarding
any financial instrument, transaction, or behaviour.
</p>

<h2>3. Non-Discretionary, User-Directed Automation</h2>

<p>
All automation executed through Chilla™ is initiated, configured, and controlled exclusively by the user.
Beaverly does not exercise discretion, judgment, or decision-making authority over:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whether automation is activated or deactivated</li>
  <li>Which behaviours or playgrounds are used</li>
  <li>Position sizing, timing, or risk parameters</li>
  <li>Capital allocation or exposure</li>
</ul>

<p>
Automation operates strictly within the parameters defined by the user.
</p>

<h2>4. Technology and Execution Risks</h2>

<p>
The use of automated systems involves inherent technical risks, including but not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Latency, connectivity issues, or service interruptions</li>
  <li>Failures or limitations of third-party broker systems</li>
  <li>Incorrect or delayed data from external sources</li>
  <li>Unexpected market conditions or volatility</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beaverly does not guarantee uninterrupted operation, error-free execution,
or the accuracy of third-party data.
</p>

<h2>5. Market Risk and Financial Loss</h2>

<p>
Financial markets are unpredictable.
Automation does not eliminate the risk of loss.
</p>

<p>
Past performance of any automation logic, configuration, or behaviour is not indicative of future results.
No representation is made that any user will achieve returns or avoid losses.
</p>

<h2>6. Risk Controls and User Safeguards</h2>

<p>
Chilla™ provides optional user-defined safeguards, such as comfort levels and monthly risk caps
(Omega Shield).
</p>

<p>
These safeguards are technical enforcement mechanisms based on user input.
They do not guarantee loss prevention and do not replace responsible risk management.
</p>

<h2>7. Automation Capacity and Service Limits</h2>

<p>
Automation services are subject to capacity limits and fair-use controls designed to ensure
platform stability and equitable access for all users.
</p>

<p>
If usage limits are reached, automation may pause temporarily.
Such pauses do not alter, override, or modify user instructions.
</p>

<h2>8. Third-Party Dependencies</h2>

<p>
Beaverly relies on third-party brokers, exchanges, data providers, and infrastructure partners.
Beaverly is not responsible for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Broker execution quality or pricing</li>
  <li>Account restrictions imposed by third parties</li>
  <li>Regulatory actions affecting third-party services</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. No Custody of Funds</h2>

<p>
Beaverly does not hold, control, or custody user funds at any time.
All funds remain with the user’s independently selected broker or platform.
</p>

<h2>10. Jurisdictional Considerations</h2>

<p>
The availability of the Services does not constitute an offer or solicitation
in any jurisdiction where such activity is unlawful.
Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 0.95rem; font-style: italic;">
Beaverly® provides technology infrastructure only.  
Nothing on this platform should be interpreted as financial, investment, or legal advice.
