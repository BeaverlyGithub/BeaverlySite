<h1>Automation Guardrails & Usage</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 28, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Purpose of Guardrails</h2>

<p>
Beaverly® is designed to enable users participate in global markets through controlled automation,
without becoming traders.
To achieve this safely and reliably, all automation on the Chilla™ platform operates within
defined guardrails.
</p>

<p>
These guardrails exist to protect users, maintain platform stability, and ensure automation
behaves exactly as instructed — and never beyond it.
</p>

<h2>2. What “Unlimited Automation (with Guardrails)” Means</h2>

<p>
When Beaverly refers to <strong>“unlimited automation”</strong>, this means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No per-behaviour fees</li>
  <li>No per-playground (market/symbol) charges</li>
  <li>No limits on the number of active instructions you can configure</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, all automation is subject to usage guardrails to prevent misuse,
unintended over-consumption of resources, or unsafe execution patterns.
These guardrails do <strong>not</strong> override user instructions — they enforce them.
</p>

<h2>3. Automation Capacity & Fair Usage</h2>

<p>
Each subscription tier includes a defined daily automation capacity.
This capacity represents the amount of computational execution available to process
your active instructions across environments.
</p>

<p>
Automation capacity is <strong>not tied to profit, trade volume, or account size</strong>.
It exists solely to ensure consistent, reliable service for all users.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Chill Mode:</strong> Standard automation capacity suitable for continuous participation</li>
  <li><strong>Deep Chill:</strong> Higher automation capacity for broader, more active configurations</li>
  <li><strong>Peak Chill:</strong> Maximum automation capacity for complex, always-on usage</li>
</ul>

<p>
If capacity limits are reached, automation pauses gracefully until capacity resets.
No instructions are altered, skipped, or modified.
</p>

<h2>4. User-Defined Risk Controls (Omega Shield)</h2>

<p>
Chilla™ includes optional user-controlled safety mechanisms such as <strong>Omega Shield</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Omega Shield allows users to define a monthly risk budget.
When the configured budget is exhausted:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automation may halt automatically for the remainder of the period</li>
  <li>No further execution may occur until the next cycle or manual adjustment</li>
</ul>

<p>
Omega Shield is a <strong>technical enforcement tool</strong>, not financial advice,
and operates strictly based on user-defined parameters.
</p>

<h2>5. Execution Transparency (Flow)</h2>

<p>
All active automation produces a human-readable execution flow.
This includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What action occurred</li>
  <li>When it occurred</li>
  <li>Where it was executed</li>
  <li>Why it occurred based on your instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Flow explanations are designed for clarity and understanding,
not trading jargon or professional terminology.
</p>

<h2>6. What Guardrails Do Not Do</h2>

<ul>
  <li>They do not make decisions for you</li>
  <li>They do not change your instructions</li>
  <li>They do not provide investment advice</li>
  <li>They do not manage or custody funds</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beaverly remains a non-custodial, non-advisory, and non-discretionary technology provider at all times.
</p>

<h2>7. Temporary Restrictions & Service Protection</h2>

<p>
In rare cases, Beaverly may temporarily restrict automation if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Usage patterns appear abusive or unintended</li>
  <li>System integrity or platform stability is at risk</li>
  <li>Regulatory or legal obligations require intervention</li>
</ul>

<p>
When this occurs, users are notified through the dashboard or email.
If a restriction is determined to be applied in error, normal access is restored.
</p>

<h2>8. Transparency Commitment</h2>

<p>
Beaverly is committed to clear communication around system behavior,
limits, and safeguards.
Our goal is to help users participate with confidence — not confusion.
